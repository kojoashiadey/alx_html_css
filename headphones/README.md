# ALX Headphones Project

This repository contains the HTML and CSS implementation of the **Headphones Website Project** designed using Figma and developed as part of the **ALX Front-End Curriculum**.

📁 Project Structure

Each file pair (`index.html` and `styles.css`) corresponds to a specific section of the full website. The sections were individually implemented to match the Figma UI design, focusing on clean structure, responsive layouts, and modern CSS styling.

| Section                       | HTML File      | CSS File        |
|-------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Header                        | `0-index.html` | `0-styles.css`  |
| “What we do…”                 | `1-index.html` | `1-styles.css`  |
| Our results                   | `2-index.html` | `2-styles.css`  |
| Contact us                    | `3-index.html` | `3-styles.css`  |
| Footer                        | `4-index.html` | `4-styles.css`  |
| Replace background with code  | `6-index.html` | `6-styles.css`  |
| Let’s animate items           | `7-index.html` | `7-styles.css`  |
| Hamburger menu (responsive)   | `8-index.html` | `8-styles.css`  |
